## PROBABILISTIC ROBOTICS PROJECT
This repository contains the code for the project of probabilistic robotics held by prof. Giorgio Grisetti.
The code is runnable, it is only needed to clone the repository, then run the following command:
```sh
octave main.m
```
The code will give as output 4 different plots:
1) Plot of the landmark positions
2) Plot of the robot trajectory
3) Plot of the robot trajectory assuming we have a calibrated odometry (that is hardcoded manually)
4) Plot of the evolution of the error
